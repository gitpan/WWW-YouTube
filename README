DESCRIPTION
    WWW::YouTube is the *Public* YouTube Development Interface (YTDI).

    WWW::YouTube::Com is your *Private* YouTube Developer's Interface.

    We need your private user, pass and dev_id defined here.

    To use the YouTube Development Interface (YTDI) through your own YouTube
    Developer's Interface, you need to have a YouTube username and password,
    and you'll need to register with YouTube as a Developer in order to get
    a Developer ID for the YouTube Developer's API at
    http://www.youtube.com/dev.

    WWW::YouTube: "Keep it FUN, CLEAN and REAL," -- "to protect children."

    I've been through the Lion's den over this very good visual-invention of
    mine, in the comp.lang.perl.modules news forum, but like Daniel did a
    very long time ago, I came out of the Lion's den completely unscathed,
    because the roaring lions, like John Bokma, had no teeth. I know that
    most of you out there will be using WWW::YouTube to suit your own
    private video purposes, solving your own problems and satisfying your
    own needs, but there will be some of you out there who might also choose
    to help me to protect innocent children, developing teenagers and the
    general public from inappropriate adult content in the public domain, by
    occasionally using the youtube/tag/tag.plx application that will always
    be included as an integral part of this distribution. Either way, for or
    against my central theme and the original purpose for the development of
    WWW::YouTube, this central tag application should always be analyzed as
    the current example of what can be engineered and developed for the
    public good, fully embracing the open-source philosophy, and fully
    respecting the First Amendment Rights of adults, while simply trying to
    protect innocent children from too many visual attacks from thoughtless
    individuals. Opportunity knocks, because the technological door is being
    opened for all of us to explore what can be done. The Good application
    has already won over the Bad application, because an instant success
    cannot be turned into something that is doomed to fail, John.

    The youtube/video/video.plx application, also provided with this
    distribution, runs a simple demo, and is intended to help you to get
    started.

    This is a functional prototype, a work in progress, so please be
    flexible for a while. Thanks.

    More to come, I promise.
