DESCRIPTION
    WWW::YouTube is the *Public* *YouTube Development Interface* (YTDI).

    WWW::YouTube::Com is your *Private* YouTube Developer's Interface.

    We need your private user, pass and dev_id defined here.

    To use the YouTube Development Interface (YTDI) through your own YouTube
    Developer's Interface, you need to have a YouTube username and password,
    and you'll need to register with YouTube as a Developer in order to get
    a Developer ID for the YouTube Developer's API at
    http://www.youtube.com/dev.

    By the way, you need to go directly to YouTube at http://www.youtube.com
    to do your registering, and you must think up a really good excuse for
    your desire to become a registered YouTube Developer.

    (Something like helping me to develop programs to protect the registered
    teenagers and the General Public, including children, from being exposed
    to too much adult content and other inappropriate material might work.)

    Now, just because a public video on YouTube has been flagged as
    inappropriate material for the General Public, doesn't mean that a
    registered adult can't watch it. Flagging keeps YouTube registered
    teenagers, and YouTube's unregistered General Public viewers, including
    children, from being able to view the contents of a public video
    identified as an inappropriate video, viewable by registered adults
    only, if they *explicitly* choose to be viewing the public videos
    flagged as "inappropriate material," during their *current* login
    session.

    You'll need to *educate* yourself and *experiment* with YouTube
    *directly*, before going hog-wild with my WWW::YouTube applications,
    like I do, flagging videos. "To protect children," that's my central
    theme and purpose for this EXPERIMENTAL *YouTube Development Interface*
    (YTDI) project, called WWW::YouTube.

    What happens with the YTDI really depends on Who, What, When, Where and
    Which action it's activated.

    And Why, and How? What *actually* happens, Why or How it *happened*,
    really matters in this world we live in, doesn't it?

    Matthew 3:12, "His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his
    threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the
    chaff with unquenchable fire." -- NIV
